have enough time to get a website rolling. So I starting looking
into what simple blog engine that allows for quite some modification
and custom themes. So I came across &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pelican.notmyidea.org"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; after going through some
static blog generators, and coming across &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pydanny.com"&gt;Pydanny&lt;/a&gt;'s Website, I decided
on Pelican. Yeah if you click on pydanny's website you'll see that they basically
look exactly the same. That is because I just followed his as a template
and we are both using the same pelican theme. Also Pydanny's website contains
a good article on all the different &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pydanny.com/choosing-a-new-python-based-blog-engine.html"&gt;static blog generators&lt;/a&gt; and how to run your &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pydanny.com/my-new-blog.html"&gt;own
pelican website&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting something decent going on in my own lil virtual box, I went to
try and deploy it. Which I knew would be the most annoying phase, since you have to
deal with various elements. Such as: your registrar, creating A records, waiting
for DNS servers to update and countless hours googling ;). But it
payed off, I will write a guide later on about how to roll your own Pelican website using github for free! (unless you want to have your own domain name)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways my head is killing from staring at the screen(s) too long! So I am going to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyaa!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~rs&lt;/p&gt;
