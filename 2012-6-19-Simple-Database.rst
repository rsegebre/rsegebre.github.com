So I have been working for some time in `problem #3`_ from 
the `Thumbtack`_ challenges.I think it is almost done and I also took this chance as an opportunity to try and learn about Java applets, 
so anybody can actually try out the simple database. 

`Try out Simple Database here!`_

You can check the git repo for it along with some of the thoughts I had while coding `here`_.
