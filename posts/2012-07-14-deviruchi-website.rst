One of my projects for my networks class was to build a website from scratch, in which we had to showcase the basics: html/css/javascript. So I built a simple website using a `smoothscroll javascript <http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/>`_ I found and `spritely <http://spritely.net/>`_ (a jQuery based sprite animation library to animate the little devil, called Deviruchi, from `Ragnarok Online <http://www.ragnarokonline.com/>`_ ). Besides the javascript, I also wrote the css and the html for the website as well as designed I guess (now it makes sense why it looks funky!), obtained most of the graphics from  a `free vector library <http://www.freevectorlibrary.com/>`_ and modified them. 

So you can check it out here:
