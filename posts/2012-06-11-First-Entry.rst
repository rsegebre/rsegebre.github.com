So now that is summer and I just graduated, I realize I finally
have enough time to get a website rolling. So I starting looking
into what simple blog engine that allows for quite some modification
and custom themes. So I came across `Pelican`_ after going through some
static blog generators, and coming across `Pydanny`_'s Website, I decided 
on Pelican. Yeah if you click on pydanny's website you'll see that they basically
look exactly the same. That is because I just followed his as a template
and we are both using the same pelican theme. Also Pydanny's website contains 
a good article on all the different `static blog generators`_ and how to run your `own 
pelican website`_ if you are interested!


After getting something decent going on in my own lil virtual box, I went to 
try and deploy it. Which I knew would be the most annoying phase, since you have to
deal with various elements. Such as: your registrar, creating A records, waiting
for DNS servers to update and countless hours googling ;). But it
payed off, I will write a guide later on about how to roll your own Pelican website using github for free! (unless you want to have your own domain name)

Anyways my head is killing from staring at the screen(s) too long! So I am going to bed.

Cyaa!
