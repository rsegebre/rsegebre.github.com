Description: Pelican Gist Tag
        ================
        
        Pelican Gist Tag is a library to make it easy to GitHub Gists in your Pelican_ blogs.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install pelican-gist, simply:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install pelican-gist
        
        Then add a bit of code to your blog configuration:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            PLUGINS = [
                # ...
                'pelican_gist',
                # ...
            ]
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        In your articles, just add lines to your posts that look like:
        
        .. code-block:: html
        
            [gist:id=3254906,file=brew-update-notifier.sh]
        
        This will tell the plugin to insert gist id ``3254906`` and choose the file ``brew-update-notifier.sh`` into your post. The resulting HTML will look like:
        
        .. code-block:: html
        
            <div class="gist">
                <script src='https://gist.github.com/3254906.js?file=brew-update-notifier.sh'></script>
                <noscript>
                    <pre><code>#!/bin/bash ...</code></pre>
                </noscript>
            </div>
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        ``GIST_CACHE_ENABLED`` - Specifies whether to cache the gist on disk or not. Default is ``True``. (Optional)
