I graduated not so long ago on, May 2012, from Colgate University. My major
was Computer Science and I also minored in Economics. I am currently
in the search for a full-time position as a Software Developer, but I am always
open for any projects. So if you have any projects you need help, please let me know!


Languages
=========

* Java
* Python
* C/C++
* Some Haskell

Some Code Samples:
==================
I haven't worked/working on anything huge but you can still checkout some of the code I've worked on:

* `Simple Database`_ (Try out the code through a `simple applet`_)
* `Baby Scheme`_
* Contributed on `Genigims`_
* `DNS Cache`_
* Many others, but I just need to get them on github.
