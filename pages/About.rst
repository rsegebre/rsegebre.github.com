Welcome to the online home of Roberto Segebre, abbreviated by rsegebre! 
In this website you can learn about my coding and technology related interests
as well as about me. If you are interested in connecting with me, you can find links at the bottom
of the page to the various social networking websites. 


I am a recent graduate of Colgate University in Hamilton, NY, US. My major at Colgate
was Computer Science and I also minored in Economics, but I still had the opportunity
to take plenty of classes in various other disciplines such as Japanese, Political Science and many others. I am currently
in the search for a full-time position as a systems administrator or software developer. I do not have a lot of practical experience at either,
but I have several skills that would make the adaptation process fast and easy. I am always
open for any projects (programming or IT related), so if you have any projects you need help with, contact me and I would gladly collaborate!


Languages
=========

* Java
* Python
* C/C++
* Some Haskell

Code Samples:
==================
Here are a couple of projects I've worked on ranging from class projects to research related. The code is hosted in github so click on the links to access the code:

* `Simple Database`_ (Try out the code through a `simple applet`_)
* `Baby Scheme`_
* Contributed on `GENIGIMS`_ (Also co-authored a `research paper`_ on GENI)
* `DNS Cache`_
* Many others, but I just need to get them on github.
